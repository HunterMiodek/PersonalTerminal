# Additional notes

Thank you for your interest in this! This was just a little side project that I made while sick at home, but a lot of people wanted a download!

I have decided not to leave my preset for CRT in, as some people might want to give a shot at making their own CRT preset.
Give it a shot! You might want to try a New Vegas amber look!

Believe it or not, I don't actually do a lot of this kind of thing, and I instead do a lot of Digital Art! I'm still learning, but you can check me out on [@fohtla_arts](http://instagram.com/fohtla_arts) on instagram. Otherwise, enjoy this little program I made for funsies!
